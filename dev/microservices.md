## Team Topologies:
1. A stream-aligned team owns and runs a deliverable piece of work and donâ€™t disband after a release
2. An enabling team supports the work of other teams with a consulting engagement model. For example, an enabling architecture team.
3. A Complicated-Subsystem team works on a domain or on subject matter that is difficult to understand.
4. A platform team provides support to the rest of the organization and deliver a self-service enablement experience to their users


##Patterns
### Saga
- every step of a transaction not only performs the required action for that step, but it also defines a rollback action

## Notes:
1. The challenge is to strike the right balance between independent work and coordinated efforts
2. Inverse Conway maneuver - addressing team coordination and team design at the beginning
